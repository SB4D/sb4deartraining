# Welcome to `sb4deartraining` - Technical ear training in Python

This repository contains work in progress on tools for technical ear training with the goal of developing critical listening skills related to music production. 
Various exercises concerning the recognition of parameter settings for common audio effects such as equalizers/filters, compressors, and delays as well level balance and stereo field recognition are or will be included. Simple implementations of these effects are included.

Currently, the exercises are realized in a minimal form in a Jupyter Notebook. Eventually, the goal is to add a web-based frontend. 

A small selection of audio samples used for training is provided. All the music was written, recorded, and performed by the repository owner.
